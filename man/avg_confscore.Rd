\usage{
avg_confscore(data)

\arguments{
\item{data}{tibble with at least a common_seed column and a prediction_output
column The prediction_output column is a list. Each element contains a
tibble with predictions and covariates.}
}
\value{
an object (tibble) with all the covariates that identify the
vessel-years, and an average predicted probability for each vessel-year
and common seed
}
\description{
For each common seed and vessel-year, it computes the average
confidence score.
