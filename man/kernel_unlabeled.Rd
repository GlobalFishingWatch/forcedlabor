\title{Computes density kernels estimated for positive and unlabeled, and the values
of those densities inferred for unlabeled predictions (sorted)}
\usage{
kernel_unlabeled(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame. Needs to have a .pred_1 column with predictions
and a known_offender column with 0 for unlabeled and 1 for positive
(offender)}
}
\value{
a list with 3 elements:
f_yp : inferred densities for positive predictions;
f_yu : inferred densities for unlabeled predictions;
y_u  : vector with the predictions of unlabeled
}
